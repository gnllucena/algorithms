arrays:
	- are they ordered?
	- ascendant or descendant?
	- are they unique?
	- are they also negative?
	- can I sort it?
	- is the array unsorted? Sort it, the solution will be simple from there

binary search tree:
	- a node's value must be stricly greater then 
		all the values of the nodes to it's left.
		and the value of a node must be less than or equal to 
		all the values of the nodes to it's right.
